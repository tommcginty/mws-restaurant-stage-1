# Udacity Front-End Developer Project Restaurant Reviews App â€“ Stage 1
---

## Project Overview:

This is a project for the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree. The site lists restaurants, and their locations on a map. The user can narrow choice down by neighbor hood and cuisine. The main page as well as any restaurant that has been viewed are saved to local storage for offline viewing.


## Dependencies:
### Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 


### Directions for use
1. Download the folder to your desktop.

2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

## TODO:

The CSS has been adjusted to meet the contrast requirements for accessability. I am not crazy about the color combinations. I would like to play around with the color palette.
